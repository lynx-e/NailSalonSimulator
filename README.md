## DESCRIPTION

This project simulates a typical day in a nail salon.

As a real-life nail tech, I'm using this simulator to practice different types of loops in Java while modeling the structure of my actual workdays.

## USER STORY

As a user, I want to simulate a typical day in a nail salon.  
I want to check if today is a working day, operate within a shift window, track the number of customers I serve, and calculate my total earnings for the day.
